        "_value": "Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a heritable disease characterized by progressive ectopic mineralization of the skin, arteries and eyes, for which no effective treatment exists. PXE is caused by inactivating mutations in the gene encoding ABCC6 (MRP6), an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that is mainly present in the liver. Abcc6-/- mice have been instrumental in demonstrating that PXE is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an unknown factor X in the circulation that is normally secreted from hepatocytes by basolateral ABCC6. Why absence of X results in PXE is a mystery. We now show that medium from HEK293 cells overexpressing human ABCC6 (hABCC6) or rat ABCC6 (rABCC6) potently inhibits mineralization in vitro, whereas medium of HEK293 control cells does not. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that cells expressing ABCC6 excrete large amounts of nucleoside triphosphates. We found that nucleotide excretion is not directly mediated via ABCC6. Extracellularly, ectonucleotidases converted these nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of mineralization that plays a pivotal role in several mineralization disorders similar to PXE. The in vivo relevance of our data was demonstrated in Abcc6-/- mice, which had plasma PPi levels that were less than approximately 40% of those found in wild-type mice. Our data provide the first insight into how ABCC6 affects PXE. We propose a model in which ABCC6 secretes factor X from the liver into the circulation, where it induces nucleoside triphosphate release. The PPi formed from these nucleotides prevents the ectopic mineralization observed in PXE patients."

The plasma layer was collected, depleted of platelets by filtration (20 min, 2,200 g, 4 oC) through a Centrisart I 300,000 kD mass cutoff filter (Sartorius) and stored at -20 oC until further processing.\nHEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 units pen/strep per ml at 37oC and 5% CO2 under humidifying conditions. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning Costar) in triplicate at a density of 7.5X105 cells per well and allowed to grow to confluence overnight. At this point, the medium was replaced with 2 ml fresh medium with or without 1 mM ARL67156 (Tocris) plus 0.5 mM AMP-PCP (Sigma). Samples of 200 \ufffdL were collected after 24  hours and frozen at -20 oC until further processing."
